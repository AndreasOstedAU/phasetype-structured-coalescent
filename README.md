# Phase type theory for the coalescent with structure

In this repo, we mainly show the implementation of formula (5.22) in Coalescent Theory: An introduction by John Wakeley (2009), which generates the subintensity matrix for the coalescent with structure. Using a phase-type distribution, this can be used to model e.g. the time to the most recent common ancestor ($T_{MRCA}$) and provides an alternative to the first-step analysis formulas in Wakeleys book.
This implementation is given in `generate_subint_matrix.R`
